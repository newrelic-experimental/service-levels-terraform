# products_map and capabilities_map are important as they are
# used to define SLO tags and naming conventions.

#
# Define your product names with numeric keys that will be used 
# in your capabilities map below.

products_map = {

#
# Define your capability names with numeric keys that will be used 
# in your capabilities map below.
# Map capabilities to your numerica product keys. 
# In the example below, "Customers" and "Accounts" are mapped
# to the "OMA" product key.

# The service level configs below require an ENTITY_GUID.  Every New Relic entity has a GUID.
# You may find an entity's GUID using in the New Relic UI by clicking the Metadata icon on the
# entity Summary page.  For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid.
# For workloads, it's workloadGuid.  You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID.
