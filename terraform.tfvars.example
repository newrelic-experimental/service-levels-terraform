#
# products_map and capabilities_map are important as they are
# used to define SLO tags and naming conventions.
#


#
# Define your product names with numeric keys that will be used 
# in your capabilities map below.
#

products_map = {
  "0" : "OMA"
}

#
# Define your capability names with numeric keys that will be used 
# in your capabilities map below.
# Map capabilities to your numerica product keys. 
# In the example below, "Customers" and "Accounts" are mapped
# to the "OMA" product key.
#
#
# The capbilities entries below require an entity guid.  Every New Relic entity has a GUID.
# You may find an entity's GUID in the New Relic UI by clicking the Metadata icon on the
# entity Summary page.  For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid.
# For workloads, it's workloadGuid.  You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID.
# Finally for a more scalable programmatic approach you can use the Nergraph entities API:
# https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-entities-api-tutorial/
